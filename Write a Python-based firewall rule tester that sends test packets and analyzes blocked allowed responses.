Aim: To write a Python-based firewall rule tester that sends test packets and analyzes 
blocked/allowed responses.
Required Tools:
 Python 3.x
 scapy library for sending test packets
Steps:
1. Install scapy:
pip install scapy
2. Write a Python script to send test packets:
from scapy.all import *
def test_firewall(destination_ip):
 print(f"Sending test packet to {destination_ip}")
 packet = IP(dst=destination_ip)/ICMP()
 response = sr1(packet, timeout=2, verbose=0)
 
 if response:
 print("Packet Allowed: Firewall is not blocking ICMP requests.")
 else:
 print("Packet Blocked: Firewall is blocking ICMP requests.")
if __name__ == "__main__":
 target_ip = input("Enter the target IP: ")
 test_firewall(target_ip)
3. Run the script and analyze responses.
Expected Outcome:
 Identifies whether ICMP packets are being blocked by the firewall.
 Helps in understanding firewall rules and configurations.
